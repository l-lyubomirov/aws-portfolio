## AWS Portfolio

This repository contains two case studies that i`ve completed in my journey of studying AWS and Terraform.
It includes two separate approaches for creating an Apache web service by using IaC principles.

In the first case study the goal was to create a fully functional web service by using basic resources and services in AWS.

In the second case study the aim was to improve the infrastructure by reducing  duplication in the code. It includes the use of the module aspect for future reuses and also includes more variables for better flexibility.
